  <h1>Lacrosse in my life</h1>
  <h2>I have been playing lacrosse since elementary school. The fast-paced, aggressive action has kept me interested in the game. I play both in and out of school, always impproving my skills to better myself and the team. Watching major and college lacrosse highlights is always something fun to do because the players pull off the most complex and stylish moves and goals, yet they make it look easy. </h2>
